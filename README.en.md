## Demo

We deployed a demo using Comment9, providing [danmaku wall](https://comment.pka.moe/#/wall/demo/screen), [danmaku list wall](https://comment.pka.moe/#/list/demo/screen), [danmaku video player](https://comment.pka.moe/#/player/demo/screen), [danmaku web page sender](https://comment.pka.moe/#/wall/demo/user/userpass) and Telegram bot [@comment9_bot](https://t.me/comment9_bot) for testing, and you may need to send your own danmakus to see the effect.

You can also directly visit the [danmaku wall](https://comment.pka.moe/#/wall/test), [danmaku list wall](https://comment.pka.moe/#/list/test) and [danmaku video player](https://comment.pka.moe/#/player/test) to see the effect when there are many danmakus.

Below is a screenshot of the web backend management system of Comment9

## Deployment

### Docker Compose Deployment

#### Install

Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/prnake/Comment9/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

```bash
wget https://github.com/prnake/Comment9/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
```

This deployment method only requires changing the `HOST` field `https://comment.pka.moe` in the `environment` section of `docker-compose.yml` to the actual deployment domain, see [#Configuration](#Configuration) for more configuration items


```bash
url="actual deploy domain"
sed -i '' "s/https:\/\/comment.pka.moe/${url}/g" docker-compose.yml
```

Launch

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Update

Remove old containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Repull the latest image if you have downloaded the image before

```bash
docker pull prnake/comment9
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Docker Deployment

#### Install

Modify the environment variables in the following command and run it. For an explanation of the configuration items, see [#Configuration](#Configuration).

```bash
docker run -it --name comment9 -p 3000:3000 \
  -e "HOST=" \
  -e "BASE_URL="  \
  -e "INVITE_CODE=" \
  -e "REDIS_HOST=" \
  -e "REDIS_PORT=" \
  -e "MONGO_HOST=" \
  -e "MONGO_DATABASE=" \
  prnake/comment9:latest
```

This deployment method requires additional configuration of MongoDB and Redis services, so please use Docker Compose deployment method or deploy external dependencies by yourself if needed.

### Manual Deployment

#### Prepare

It is recommended to install with `yarn` in an environment with Node.js version no less than 14, and if you don't have MongoDB and Redis services, you can use Docker to start them.

```bash
docker run -d --name mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

#### Install

Pull source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prnake/Comment9
cd Comment9
```

Create a new `.env` file in the project root directory and add environment variables in `NAME=VALUE` format on each line, e.g. fill in the deployment domain

```env
HOST="actual deploy domain"
```

If you use your own MongoDB and Redis services, you will need to configure them additionally, see [#Configuration](#Configuration)

Building the front end

```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

Launch

```bash
yarn start
```

Or use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)

```bash
pm2 start
```

## Configuration

To configure Comment9 by setting environment variables, create a new `.env` file in the project root directory and add environment variables in `NAME=VALUE` format on each line

| environment    | default_value         | description                  |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| PORT           | 3000                  | the port on which the web server is listening |
| HOST           | http://localhost:3000 | deploy domain                     |
| BASE_URL       |                       | deploy subpath, such as "/comment"  |
| INVITE_CODE    |                       | required at registration, used to limit registration |
| MONGO_USERNAME | null                  | mongodb configuration                 |
| MONGO_PASSWORD | null                  | mongodb configuration                 |
| MONGO_HOST     | 127.0.0.1             | mongodb configuration                 |
| MONGO_PORT     | 27017                 | mongodb configuration                 |
| MONGO_DATABASE | Comment9              | mongodb configuration                 |
| REDIS_HOST     |                       | redis configuration                   |
| REDIS_PORT     |                       | redis configuration                   |
| REDIS_PASSWORD |                       | redis configuration                   |
| SECRET         | Danmaku               | express session secret    |

You can also read the `config.js` file to see the configurable environment variables.

## Usage

### Use API to actively collect Bilibili live danmakus

Here we use [bililive_dm](https://github.com/copyliu/bililive_dm) to collect danmakus from Bilibili live stream, and send them to the Comment9 server via [python-socketio](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/ en/latest), see [example/bilibili](example/bilibili) folder for details.

### Presence Features & Bugs

- You can use the activity name in the url instead of the activity id for indexing, for example [#Demo](#Demo) uses this method
- The audit screen is focused on the input box, the keyboard passes to the right and rejects to the left
- Each danmaku will only appear once in the audit, if there is an un-audited danmaku before refreshing the page, the danmaku will remain un-audited
- Deployment domain must be configured manually, e.g. messages sent to WeChat and Telegram need to have this field in the message
- ElementUI's i18n does not work properly
